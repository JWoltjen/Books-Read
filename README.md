## Lessons Learned

Material UI is an opinionated component-based library for react that favors in-line styling over traditional cascading style sheet rules. Material UI is really strong in making things responsive. This is because it uses premade components and containers. As long as the developer knows which container to use in a certain situation, it is difficult to get the layout to break on mobile and it is easy to correct.
